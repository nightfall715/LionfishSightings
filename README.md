# Lionfish Sightings: Focus on US Gulf Coast 2013
### Created for UNC ENGL 105.75
This repository contains:
1. A database listing sightings of the invasive Lionfish throughout the Americas
2. A guided Google CoLab analysis of the dataset, filtering it down to sightings from 2013 on the US Gulf Coast
3. A final filtered dataset

# Purpose
Invasive species are a developing anthropogenic phenomenon that can destabilize ecosystems. A classic example of an invasive species is the Lionfish, which was a popular aquarium fish often cast off into American waters, where it quickly populated without restraint. This repository is meant to help inform research investigating the abundance of invasive species in American coastal waters, specifically the spread of the Lionfish geographically over time. Unerstanding the population dynamics of invasive species is critical to limiting the stress they put on native food webs.
# Source
The original dataset for this repository comes from the United States Geological Survey Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species database ([link](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/CollectionInfo.aspx?SpeciesID=963)), which is a compilation of many independently conducted surveys, intended to provide public access to invasive species data.
